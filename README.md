# Example-AI-ChatBot
This is a C# program that creates a simple chatbot using an array of keywords and responses. The program initializes two arrays: "keywords" and "responses" which hold a list of keywords that the chatbot will recognize and the corresponding responses to those keywords. The program then uses a while loop to repeatedly ask for user input and check if it matches any of the keywords in the array. If a match is found, the corresponding response is printed. If no match is found, the program will respond with "I'm sorry, I didn't understand." The loop continues until the user inputs "goodbye" which will exit the loop and end the program. This is a basic example of a chatbot, it can be further enhanced with more advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
